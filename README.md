## Avro schemas for FHIR resources

As the healthcare technology landscape becomes increasingly complex, it is more
important than ever to have common, robust ways to exchange health information.
One way to address this need is through open standardization. The goal of this
project is to help promote the adoption of open standards by assembling a
collection of Avro schemas for FHIR resources.

Avro and FHIR are both
- open source
- widely adopted (and increasingly so)
- language/platform neutral
- developer/human friendly
These attributes make them well suited to modern challenges of healthcare data
exchange.

## To use this project
Just grab schemas from the schemas/ directory and use them to serialize your
data with Avro.
