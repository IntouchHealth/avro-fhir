## Avro schemas for FHIR resources

WORK IN PROGRESS

As the healthcare technology landscape becomes ever more complex, it is more
important than ever to have robust ways to communicate information. One way to
address this need is standardization.

This project brings together FHIR and Avro. Both these standards are
- open source
- widely adopted (and on the rise)
- language/platform neutral
